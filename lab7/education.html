            <h2>Sri Aurobindo Mira Matriculation School</h2>
            <p>
                My favorite class is Mathematics, because that's only subject during my school days I understood well and liked it to. Always I score high in mathematics. I think in my high school final exam I am school first in Mathematics.
            </p>
            <aside> My memorable memory would be at that time, we were allowed to drive only bike. Once my school is over, me and friend used to roam around in bike all over my place. We used to have some money and always crazy about street food have eaten in almost all the shop and playing Playstation with friends are one of my memorable time during school days.</aside>

            <h2>Thiagarajar college of Engineering</h2>
            <p>
                My favorite class is Data structure, professor is really good on this subject and she taught diligently and made it look easy while she teaching although data structure is only of tough subject because of that professor I had avid interest in understanding coding concept.
            </p>
            <aside> My memorable memory is, I am college tennis team captain used to talk with juniors and coach them, also my university ranked high and is liberal so along with friends we used to roam around my city watching series and movies late night at hostel is fun.</aside>

            <h2>Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
            <p>
                My favorite class is Web programming, honestly I liked this course and choose it because I had work experience on web development that grabbed my interest initially and professor is really good in teaching, in every lecture we are seeing practical implementation of concept and we were informed earlier on what needs to be done for assignment.
            </p>
            <aside> My memorable memory would be until now, playing tennis at university and view of skyscrapper from university is awesome.</aside>
